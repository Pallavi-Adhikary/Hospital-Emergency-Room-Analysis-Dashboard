# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Dashboard
Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a simple and effective Emergency Room (ER) analysis dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to help hospital staff track key metrics and identify areas for operational improvement.

Business Problem
Hospitals often face challenges in:

Monitoring the number of daily ER visits

Tracking average patient wait times

Measuring patient satisfaction consistently

Without a structured view, it is difficult to analyze trends or take action to improve patient experience.

Steps Followed
Requirement Gathering: Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) that needed to be tracked

Data Understanding: Reviewed the structure and quality of the dataset

Data Import & Cleaning: Used Power Query to import and clean data

Created Calendar Table: Enabled date-based analysis

Data Modeling in Power Pivot: Built relationships between tables

DAX Calculations: Created calculated columns and KPIs, such as average wait time

Built Pivot Tables: Summarized key metrics effectively

Dashboard Design: Combined charts and KPIs into a clean, one-page layout

KPIs Tracked
Total Number of Patients per Day

Average Wait Time

Patient Satisfaction Score

All KPIs were visualized using pivot charts and sparklines to observe daily trends and patterns.

Result
The final dashboard provided a clear summary of ER performance, enabling users to:

View daily trends

Identify peak hours or problem areas

Monitor overall service quality
