# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Dashboard

## Project Purpose

This project aims to develop a simple yet effective dashboard in Microsoft Excel to help hospital staff monitor key Emergency Room (ER) performance metrics. The dashboard supports data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.

## Business Problem

Hospitals face challenges in:

* Tracking the daily volume of ER visits
* Monitoring average patient wait times
* Measuring patient satisfaction consistently

Without a consolidated view of these metrics, it is difficult to identify trends and address operational bottlenecks.

## Approach and Methodology

* **Requirement Gathering:** Defined the essential KPIs to track ER performance
* **Data Understanding:** Analyzed the datasetâ€™s structure and quality to ensure reliability
* **Data Import & Cleaning:** Utilized Power Query in Excel for efficient data cleansing and preparation
* **Calendar Table Creation:** Developed a date table to enable time-based analyses
* **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between tables using Power Pivot
* **DAX Calculations:** Created calculated columns and measures to compute KPIs such as average wait time
* **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Designed summaries to display key metrics interactively
* **Dashboard Design:** Built a user-friendly, one-page Excel dashboard combining charts, KPIs, and sparklines for trend visualization

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Total number of ER patients per day
* Average patient wait time
* Patient satisfaction scores

## Outcome

The dashboard provides a concise and interactive overview of ER operations, allowing stakeholders to:

* Monitor daily trends in patient visits and wait times
* Identify peak hours and potential bottlenecks
* Assess overall service quality for continuous improvement

## Tools and Technologies

* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query
* Power Pivot
* Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
* Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

## Learnings

* Data cleaning and preparation using Power Query
* Data modeling and relationship management in Power Pivot
* Writing DAX formulas to calculate dynamic KPIs
* Designing effective and interactive dashboards in Excel
